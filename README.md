![architecture](doc/source/images/architecture.png)

<!--Optionally, add flow steps based on the architecture diagram-->
## Flow

1. User uploads a video or audio file.
2. If it is a video, then audio is extracted from the video.
3. The audio is sent to Watson Speech to Text that transcribes the audio to text.
4. The text is then summarized with different summarizers.
5. The speaker diarization, summary and transcript are displayed on the UI.
6. User can then download the insights.

<!--Optionally, update this section when the video is created-->

## 5. Watson Speech to Text Optimization
The Watson Speech to Text model can be optimized further to get more precise and accurate results. In this section you will learn about the following speech recognition parameters of the Watson Speech to Text:
- Speaker labels (Beta)
- Smart formatting
- End of phrase silence time
- Numeric redaction (Beta)
- Profanity filtering (Beta)

### Speaker Labels (Beta)

Speaker labels parameter in Watson™ Speech to Text, identifies which person spoke which words in a conversation. It is best optimized for two person conversation scenario, however it can support upto 6 person but the performance may vary. 

Example: Telephone conversation between two people, Q&A between two people, etc.

To enable Speaker labels, add the `speaker_labels` parameter and set it to `true`.

```python
def Transcribe(audiofilepath):
    with open(audiofilepath, 'rb') as audio_file:
        speech_recognition_results = speech_to_text.recognize(
                audio=audio_file,
                content_type='audio/wav',
                model='en-US_NarrowbandModel',
                speaker_labels=True
            ).get_result()

    return speech_recognition_results
```

>Note: We are using an **US English NarrowBand Model** to transcribe the audio. ***NarrowBand Model*** is optimized for human to human conversations, whereas, ***BroadBand Model*** is optimized for human to bot or vice-versa conversations. Change your model accordingly.

>Note: Speaker Labels is already enabled in this code pattern. ✔️

>Learn more about Speaker Labels [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-speaker-labels).

### Smart formatting

Smart formatting parameter in Watson™ Speech to Text, converts the following strings into more conventional representations:
- Dates
- Times
- Series of digits and numbers
- Phone numbers
- Currency values (for US English and Spanish)
- Internet email and web addresses (for US English and Spanish)

Example:

String Type|Smart formatting OFF ❌|Smart formatting ON ✔️
--|--|--
Dates|I was born on the ninth of December nineteen hundred|I was born on 12/9/1900
Times|The meeting starts at nine thirty AM|The meeting starts at 9:30 AM
Numbers|The quantity is one million one hundred and one dollar|The quantity is $1000101
Phone numbers|Call me at nine one four two three seven one thousand|Call me at 914-237-1000
Internet email and web addresses|My email address is john dot doe at foo dot com|My email address is john.doe@foo.com
Combinations|The code is zero two four eight one and the date of service is May fifth two thousand and one|The code is 02481 and the date of service is 5/5/2001

To enable Smart formatting, add the `smart_formatting` parameter and set it to `true`.

```python
def Transcribe(audiofilepath):
    with open(audiofilepath, 'rb') as audio_file:
        speech_recognition_results = speech_to_text.recognize(
                audio=audio_file,
                content_type='audio/wav',
                model='en-US_NarrowbandModel',
                speaker_labels=True,
                smart_formatting=True
            ).get_result()

    return speech_recognition_results
```

>Note: Speaker Labels is already enabled in this code pattern. ✔️

>Learn more about Smart formatting [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-formatting).

### End of phrase silence time

End of phrase silence time parameter in Watson™ Speech to Text, specifies the duration of the pause interval at which the transcript has to be split. This parameter improves the sentence formation in the transcript.

Example:

If a person speaks numbers such as one two three four with a pause between three and four, the transcript would be something like this if the End of phrase silence time not set:

"One two three"

"four"

However if the End of phrase silence time is set to say 1sec or 1.5sec then the transcript would be something like this:

"One two three four"

To enable End of phrase silence time, add the `end_of_phrase_silence_time` parameter and set it to desired time for example `1.5`sec.

```python
def Transcribe(audiofilepath):
    with open(audiofilepath, 'rb') as audio_file:
        speech_recognition_results = speech_to_text.recognize(
                audio=audio_file,
                content_type='audio/wav',
                model='en-US_NarrowbandModel',
                speaker_labels=True,
                smart_formatting=True,
                end_of_phrase_silence_time=1.5
            ).get_result()

    return speech_recognition_results
```

>Note: End of phrase silence time is already enabled in this code pattern. ✔️

>Learn more about End of phrase silence time [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-parsing#silence-time).

### Numeric redaction (Beta)

Numeric redaction parameter in Watson™ Speech to Text, masks the numeric data from final transcripts. It is a useful feature when dealing with PII data.

Example:

Numeric redaction OFF ❌|Numeric redaction ON ✔️
--|--
my credit card number is four one four seven two nine one three one seven eight two seven nine two six| my credit card number is xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-7926

To enable Numeric redaction, add the `redaction` parameter and and set it to `true`.

```python
def Transcribe(audiofilepath):
    with open(audiofilepath, 'rb') as audio_file:
        speech_recognition_results = speech_to_text.recognize(
                audio=audio_file,
                content_type='audio/wav',
                model='en-US_NarrowbandModel',
                speaker_labels=True,
                smart_formatting=True,
                end_of_phrase_silence_time=1.5,
                redaction=True
            ).get_result()

    return speech_recognition_results
```

>Learn more about Numeric redaction [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-formatting#numeric-redaction).

### Profanity filtering (Beta)

Profanity filtering parameter in Watson™ Speech to Text, censors profanity from its results. It is enabled by default, you can disable the feature if you want the words in the output exactly as transcribed.
 
Example:

Profanity filtering OFF ❌|Profanity filtering ON ✔️
--|--
_Fword_ you| **** you

To disable Profanity filtering, add the `redaction` parameter and and set it to `false`.

```python
def Transcribe(audiofilepath):
    with open(audiofilepath, 'rb') as audio_file:
        speech_recognition_results = speech_to_text.recognize(
                audio=audio_file,
                content_type='audio/wav',
                model='en-US_NarrowbandModel',
                speaker_labels=True,
                smart_formatting=True,
                end_of_phrase_silence_time=1.5,
                redaction=True,
                profanity_filter=False
            ).get_result()

    return speech_recognition_results
```
